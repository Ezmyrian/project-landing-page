In this project the objective is to create a look-alike web page from scratch. The only thing that was provided was an image of the desired outcome and information for a few basic colors, fonts, and font size. The desired outcome and the color and font information can be found in the img folder as Landing-page.png and colors_and_stuff.png By the end of the project, I will have demonstrated the ability to create a simple web page from scratch and style it.
